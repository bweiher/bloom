Description: Designed primarily for dashboards, where reactive inputs filter data and then a common 
    summary function is applied. Bloom allows this filtering and aggregation to take place beforehand, 
    allowing your UI to merely fetch pre-filtered, pre-aggregated data to greatly improve performance,
    user experience and ultimately reduce the file size that must be read into R.
